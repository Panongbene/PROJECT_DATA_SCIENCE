# Ambiguous Uses of “Safe Mode”

The term “Safe Mode” is used in different contexts:

- In firmware v3.x, Safe Mode is a diagnostic state freezing AI decision-making but maintaining limited sensor input.
- In operational manuals, Safe Mode often refers to Isolation Mode, which cuts external communication.
- Some technician notes describe Safe Mode as a low-power state with network bridges active.
- Users must always confirm system version and exact meaning before executing Safe Mode commands.

This ambiguity has caused multiple incidents where operators unintentionally left the system in an unintended state.

# Document Similarity
The objective of this programming assignment is to be able to implement a system for document similarity, using the Min-Hash and Locality Sensitive Hashing methods presented in the lectures.

# Description
this directory contains 5 files which are as follows:
 * tweets.txt : which is a test file containing documents to compare for our algorithms. This file was downloaded from https://www.lri.fr/~maniu/tweets.txt
 * Report_Document_Similarity.pdf : This file contains the report of our work
 * Project_Requirements.pdf : This file contains the description of the work to be done
 * Panongbene_jean_mohamed_sawadog.py : This file contains the program we made in python version
 * Panongbene_Jean_Mohamed_Sawadogo.ipynb : This file contains the program we made in jupyter version
 
# Run program

For the python file to work, you will need to run the panongbene_jean_mohamed_sawadogo.py program on a terminal like so:
panongbene_jean_mohamed_sawadogo.py name_file.txt similarity_value
where name_file.txt is a file that is in the same directory as the python program and similarity_value is the value of the jaccard similarity threshold.
for example by running the following command :
 - python Panongbene_jean_mohamed_sawadog.py tweets.txt 0.05
we will see this in the terminal.
